# flutter-linux-installer-with-android-studio
This script will install flutter locally, download the android SDK, and configure everything.

I kept getting errors where running `flutter doctor` couldn't find the correct SDK location and it took me ages to figure out, so I wrote this script.

# Warning
Script will backup your folders $HOME/Android and $HOME/flutter. It will then download android SDK tools and flutter.

# Before running
Before running, you do need to download android studio ladybug and extract it to $HOME/android-studio-ladybug/
